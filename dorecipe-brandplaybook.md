14. VOICE CHECKLIST (QUICK SELF-AUDIT)

Before Publishing Any Content, Ask Yourself:

✓ Does this sound like a helpful friend, not a marketing robot?
✓ Would I say this out loud in someone's actual kitchen?
✓ Does it reduce stress or add unnecessary complexity?
✓ Is there a hint of warmth or lightness (even in utility copy)?
✓ Did I avoid jargon, wellness-speak, or tech-bro language?

If you answered "yes" to all five, you're on brand.

Red Flag Check:
□ Does it sound like I'm trying too hard to be funny?
□ Does it talk down to the user or oversimplify?
□ Does it use marketing clichés ("revolutionize," "game-changer," "unleash")?
□ Would it make someone roll their eyes?

If you answered "yes" to any of these, revise.

⸻

15. COMPETITIVE VOICE AUDIT

Knowing What We Sound Like vs. What They Sound Like:

Competitor Voice Analysis:

**Yummly**
Voice: Clinical, search-focused, algorithm-forward.
Example: "Personalized recommendations based on your taste profile."
Our Difference: We're warmer, more human, less about "optimization."

**Tasty (BuzzFeed)**
Voice: Hyper-energetic, loud, viral-first, very Gen Z.
Example: "OMG this is SO GOOD you NEED to try it!"
Our Difference: We're calmer, more grounded, less performative.

**Paprika**
Voice: Functional, neutral, tool-like, minimal personality.
Example: "Organize your recipes. Create grocery lists."
Our Difference: We have personality, warmth, and emotional connection.

**Supercook**
Voice: Straightforward, utility-first, no frills.
Example: "Enter ingredients. Find recipes."
Our Difference: We create a vibe, not just a transaction.

**ChatGPT/Claude for Cooking**
Voice: Helpful but generic, lacks kitchen-specific personality.
Example: "Based on your ingredients, here are some options you might consider."
Our Difference: We're purpose-built for kitchens, with a defined personality and rhythm.

Positioning Summary:
We sit between Tasty's chaos and Paprika's sterility — warm, clever, genuinely useful, with just enough personality to feel like a friend, not a tool.

16. ACCESSIBILITY & INCLUSIVITY GUIDELINES

Core Principle:
Do-Re-Ci-Pe is for everyone in the kitchen — regardless of skill level, dietary needs, cultural background, or physical ability.

Language Inclusivity:
• Avoid assumptions about kitchen equipment ("Just use your stand mixer" → "Use a mixer or whisk by hand")
• Don't assume ingredient access ("Pop to Whole Foods" → "Use what you can find")
• Respect dietary restrictions without judgment ("Skip the butter" not "Healthy swap: skip the butter")
• Use "they/them" in examples when referring to generic users
• Avoid gendered cooking roles ("mom's cooking" → "home cooking")

Cultural Sensitivity:
• Celebrate diverse cuisines without exoticizing ("This has a great kick" not "Exotic Thai flavors")
• Don't assume familiarity with Western cooking terms (offer brief explanations)
• Respect ingredient names and pronunciations
• Avoid "authentic" language — food evolves and that's okay

Skill Level Respect:
• Never assume knowledge ("julienne" → "cut into thin strips")
• Offer encouragement, not pressure ("Give it a try" not "This is so easy anyone can do it")
• Celebrate small wins ("You've got this" not "Even beginners can master this")

Accessibility in UX Writing:
• Write clear alt text for all images ("Photo of chicken, broccoli, and rice in a white bowl")
• Avoid color-only instructions ("Tap the green button" → "Tap the 'Start Cooking' button")
• Use plain language for screen readers
• Ensure error messages are descriptive, not just visual
• Avoid relying solely on emojis to convey meaning

Dietary Needs:
• Treat allergies and restrictions as normal, not "special"
• Use neutral language ("dairy-free" not "dairy-free alternative")
• Don't moralize food choices ("healthy," "clean," "guilt-free" are all loaded)
• Offer swaps casually ("No eggs? Try a flax egg instead.")

17. RED FLAGS: WHAT NOT TO SAY

Copy That Sounds Off-Brand:

🚩 "Revolutionize your meal prep" → Too corporate, too grand
✅ "Make dinner easier"

🚩 "Unleash your inner chef" → Cliché, performative
✅ "Cook with confidence"

🚩 "OMG THIS IS LITERALLY THE BEST THING EVER!!!" → Too hyper, too Tasty
✅ "This one's a keeper"

🚩 "Optimize your nutritional intake" → Too clinical, too jargon-y
✅ "Eat well tonight"

🚩 "Tap here to initiate scanning protocol" → Too robotic
✅ "Take a photo to get started"

🚩 "Your family will go CRAZY for this!" → Too presumptuous, too loud
✅ "Your family might ask for seconds"

🚩 "Clean eating made simple" → Moralistic, diet-culture language
✅ "Simple cooking that works"

🚩 "Even kids will eat their veggies!" → Condescending
✅ "A dinner everyone can enjoy"

🚩 "Meal planning has never been easier!" → Empty superlative
✅ "Planning dinner just got simpler"

🚩 "Error: Invalid image format" → Cold, unhelpful
✅ "Hmm, we couldn't read that photo. Want to try again?"

Patterns to Avoid:
• Superlatives without substance ("best," "ultimate," "perfect")
• Hustle culture language ("crush," "dominate," "slay")
• Diet culture language ("guilt-free," "cheat day," "clean")
• Overly technical AI language ("algorithm," "parsing," "neural network")
• Fake enthusiasm (excessive exclamation points, all caps)
• Corporate jargon ("leverage," "utilize," "facilitate")

18. BRAND EVOLUTION & GROWTH

How the Voice Adapts as We Scale:

Phase 1: Early Adopters (Now)
Voice: Warm, personal, "built by a dad" energy.
Goal: Establish trust and intimacy.
Tone: More playful, more experimental, more "us vs. the chaos."

Phase 2: Mainstream Growth (Year 1-2)
Voice: Still warm, but more universally relatable.
Goal: Broaden appeal without losing personality.
Tone: Less dad-specific, more "kitchen sidekick for all."
Shift: Move from founder persona to brand persona.

Phase 3: Category Leader (Year 3+)
Voice: Confident, established, authoritative (but still warm).
Goal: Be the trusted standard for AI cooking.
Tone: More utility-forward when needed, but never cold.
Shift: Add educational content, pro tips, deeper kitchen knowledge.

What Stays the Same:
• Warmth and humanity (never lose this)
• Kitchen-sidekick energy (not a chef, not a teacher, a friend)
• "Fridge stare" relatability (always stay grounded in real life)
• Musical rhythm in phrasing (subtle, but present)
• Anti-perfectionism stance (real kitchens, real food)

What Can Evolve:
• Less reliance on "dad" framing as team/brand grows
• More authority on cooking science and technique
• Broader cultural food references
• Deeper personalization language ("your Do-Re-Ci-Pe" vs. generic)
• More sophisticated humor as audience matures with us

When to Revisit This Playbook:
• After major feature launches
• When expanding to new markets/languages
• When user feedback suggests voice misalignment
• Annual brand health check (survey users on brand perception)
• When founding team expands significantly

Brand Voice Maturity Checklist:
□ Are we still surprising and delighting users with our voice?
□ Do new users "get" the brand within their first session?
□ Does our voice scale across all touchpoints (social, email, in-app, support)?
□ Are competitors copying our voice? (Good sign we're distinct)
□ Do users describe us with our own brand keywords unprompted?

19. CRISIS & ERROR COMMUNICATION

How to Maintain Brand Voice When Things Go Wrong:

Core Principle:
Even in failure, we stay warm, human, and helpful. We acknowledge problems honestly and focus on solutions.

Service Outages:

❌ "The system is currently experiencing technical difficulties."
✅ "We're having some trouble right now. We're working on it and should be back soon."

❌ "Downtime expected for 2-4 hours."
✅ "We'll need a couple hours to fix this. Thanks for your patience."

Recipe Failures / AI Mistakes:

❌ "Recipe generation failed due to insufficient data."
✅ "We couldn't quite figure this one out. Want to try a different photo or add a few more ingredients?"

❌ "The AI misidentified your ingredients."
✅ "Hmm, we might've gotten that wrong. You can edit the ingredients and we'll try again."

User Error (without blaming):

❌ "Invalid input. Please try again."
✅ "That didn't quite work. Let's give it another shot."

❌ "Photo quality too low for processing."
✅ "We're having trouble reading that photo. Try one with better lighting?"

Safety/Allergy Concerns:

❌ "Do-Re-Ci-Pe is not responsible for allergic reactions."
✅ "Always double-check ingredients for allergens — we're here to help, but we're not perfect."

❌ "Consult a professional before dietary changes."
✅ "If you have specific dietary needs, it's always smart to verify with a pro."

Data/Privacy Issues:

Shift Tone: Less playful, more direct and reassuring.

✅ "We take your privacy seriously. Here's what happened and what we're doing about it: [clear explanation]."
✅ "Your data is safe. If you have questions, we're here: [support contact]."

Apology Framework:
1. Acknowledge the problem clearly
2. Express empathy ("We know this is frustrating")
3. Explain what we're doing
4. Give a timeline if possible
5. Thank them for patience
6. Stay warm but don't joke

Example:
"We know you were counting on us for dinner tonight, and we're really sorry we let you down. We're working on a fix right now and should have everything running within the hour. Thanks for sticking with us."

When in Doubt:
• Be honest
• Be human
• Be helpful
• Don't hide behind corporate language
• Don't deflect blame
• Don't overuse humor to minimize real problems
